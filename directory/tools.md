# Tools & Utilities

Development tools, CLI utilities, monitoring, analytics, and CI/CD integrations for x402 builders.

---

> ★ **Featured — October 2026: [ToolMeter](https://snappedai.com/toolmeter/)**
> Seller-readiness checks before a paid endpoint launches: pricing metadata, `.well-known/x402`, OpenAPI, agent metadata, buyer-safety. Our July delivery check found most failures were front doors, not services. This tool works on the front door.

## Spending Controls & Policy

- [agent.pw](https://github.com/smithery-ai/agent.pw) — Self-hostable MIT credential vault for agent API keys and OAuth tokens. Addresses the gap nobody in the pay-per-call world talks about: agents still need somewhere safe to keep the keys x402 didn't replace.
